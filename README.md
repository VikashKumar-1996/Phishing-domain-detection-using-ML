### Overview

This project implements an end-to-end phishing domain detection system using gradient boosting and modern deployment infrastructure. The system predicts whether a website is phishing or legitimate based on engineered domain features derived from the UCI Phishing Websites dataset.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle:

Data ingestion and preprocessing

Model training and optimization

Model evaluation and threshold calibration

API development for model serving

Frontend integration

Containerized deployment to cloud infrastructure

This system is publicly deployed and accessible via both a web interface and REST API.

### Key Features

Production-ready ML model deployment using FastAPI

LightGBM classifier optimized for phishing detection

Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

Threshold-based decision calibration for production classification

REST API with structured input validation using Pydantic

Public cloud deployment using Docker and Render

Frontend UI for interactive testing

Modular and scalable system architecture
